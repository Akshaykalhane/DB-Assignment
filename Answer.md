Q.1.
Answer :
Based on above diagram we can say product entiry and the product_category table is likely a one-to-many realtionship.
one product can belong to only one category. However, one product category can have many products associated with it.

So, the relationship between the "product" entity and the "product_category" table is established through the "category_id" column in the "product" table, which references the primary key of the "product_category" table.

Q2.
Answer : 
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint.
